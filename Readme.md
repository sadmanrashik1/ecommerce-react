- React Router v6 (routing + data loaders/actions)
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI (styling & components)
- React Toastify (user feedback)
- Vite (fast development & build tool)

**Backend**

## How the project was built

- Primarily followed John Smilga’s excellent full-stack React course as the learning foundation
- Completed every challenge step-by-step (routing, loaders, Redux cart/user slices, filters, pagination, auth, checkout, orders)
- Actively debugged, refactored, and tested across devices

## Future Plans / In Progress

- Migrate to **Next.js 14+ App Router** with Server Components & Server Actions
- Replace backend with custom **PostgreSQL** backend
- Add **TypeScript** across the entire codebase
- Integrate real payment gateway (Stripe test mode)
- Add AI-powered feature (e.g. product recommendation or smart search)
